Sources used for the project:

I wrote most of the code myself, but when having trouble troubleshooting camera issues, I also asked ChatGPT for help. 
I ended up dumping the whole source code for the ChatGPT to figure out what went wrong, why couldn't I get taken photo to show up on the feed as planned.
Due to hurry I didn't have time to selectively make changes for the camera functions, but rather took ChatGPT's output as I asked it to only apply new method for accessing files with FileProvider.
Later I noticed, it also changed some of the parts which I didn't want it to change and resulted some of my own code to be overwritten by the AI.
My original code from the previous excercises is available in my earlier commits, so there is some reference to see what my own code looked like.

So I used AI for the camera functionality troubleshooting but wrote other parts of the code myself at least once during the process. Camera functionality ended up not working in the end anyways.
AI helped me with libraries as well, informing me which permissions I should add to make things work. I completelly borrowed file_paths.xml from ChatGPT.

I used developer.android.com for most of the information searching.
